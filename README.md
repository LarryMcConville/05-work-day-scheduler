## Project Goal

Create a daily planner which presents the current business day when opened
Standard business hours should be defined such as 7 - 4, 8 - 5, 9 - 6, and day should be presented in one hour blocks accordingly.
The time blocks need to be color coded to represent `Past`, `Present` and `Future` time periods.
Past hours will be `Gray`, the current hour will be `Red` and future hours will be `Green`.
when a time block is clicked the user can enter a new or update a current event.
saving an event writes it to local storage, when the page

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
